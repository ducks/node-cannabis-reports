How you would like the results sorted.

You can include a single sort option to get the records by when they
were updated, created, or alphabetically.

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Sort Option</th>
      <th>Sort Direction</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>createdAt</td>
      <td>Oldest records.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-createdAt</td>
      <td>Newest records.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>updatedAt</td>
      <td>Oldest updated records</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-updatedAt</td>
      <td>Newly updated records.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>name</td>
      <td>Alphabetically stating with numeric strains. 0-9, A-Z.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-name</td>
      <td>Alphabetically starting with Z and working back through numeric
        strains. Z-A, 9-0.</td>
    </tr>
